# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple iOS app that allows users to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer. The app displays an image of the computer's choice, a countdown timer, and buttons for the user to choose their own move.

## Usage
To play the game, simply tap the "Shoot!" button to start the countdown timer. The computer will randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the user can then select their move by tapping one of the corresponding buttons. The app will then reveal the computer's choice, and display the user's score.

## Implementation
The app is written in Swift using the SwiftUI framework. It uses the Timer class to implement the countdown timer, and uses a simple algorithm to determine the computer's move based on a random number generator and the user's move. The user's score is displayed using a Text view, and the images are displayed using Image views.

## Improvements
## Some possible improvements to the app could include:
* Adding a "Best of X" option to allow users to play multiple rounds
* Adding animations to make the app more engaging
* Allowing users to choose between different difficulty levels
